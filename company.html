                  <h6> The story all begins when... </h6>
                  <p>Brian Robertson was in his first week of a program called devCodeCamp in Milwaukee Wisconsin. He had just moved into an apartment that didn't have any parking available for the first three days. He was told to call the City and request special permission to keep his car on the street over night. The City also had alternate side parking rules that are the opposite as how it worked in his previous town. He had to call each night and get a confirmation number, then juggle finding spots, plus planning so the spot would work for the following daytime parking as well. After the issue was finally resolved, it occured to Brian that he had been playing some sort of twisted game that had been forced upon him. He decided it should be a game for everyone and the rest is history. On behalf of ParkCoGame we wish you happy parking!</p>
